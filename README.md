The bot that does basically you could ever need (WIP).

This is my attempt at that with all the features I feel a bot should and can have.

Consider this a side project if you will that I make to fulfill what I want.

Please note if somehow your seeing this, the bot is still in a "pre beta" stage, and is nowhere close to where it should be.

If you do think that this is an interesting project, come back to it later, and hopefully I've released v1 of the bot.
